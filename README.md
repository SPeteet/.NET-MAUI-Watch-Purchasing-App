This is a .NET MAUI application that showcases a log in page using a username and password. It's implemented using SQLite.
There is also a page that shows multiple watches being displayed and tapping on one brings up a description and a button where the user can add to cart. Once they add to the cart, they are able to view the cart and see the total for the items listed within. The purchase button has not been implemented within the cart.
